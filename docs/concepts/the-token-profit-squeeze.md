# The Token-Profit Squeeze

*A structural pattern in agentic businesses. Per-seat revenue stays roughly flat as a heavy AI-using employee scales their work, while per-token compute cost climbs exponentially. The gap closes, then crosses, then collapses the margin on the seat.*

![Four-panel comic. Title bar: THE TOKEN-PROFIT SQUEEZE. Panel 1 THE HEALTHY GAP: the hyperagent in his matte-navy Supersuit with vivid orange seam accents works at his physical workshop terminal; above the central monitor a HUD chart floats showing a blue PER-SEAT REVENUE line above a red PER-TOKEN COST curve with a glowing green wedge between them stamped HEALTHY MARGIN; small AI sub-agent glyphs float around the workshop. Caption: The seat is profitable. The AI cost is small relative to what the seat earns. Panel 2 THE GAP CLOSES: same workshop, charged atmosphere; the HUD chart now shows the red PER-TOKEN COST curve bending sharply upward toward the PER-SEAT REVENUE line; three crimson floating headline cards layered over the chart read SUBSIDY ERA ENDING / PRICES UP 20-37% / BUDGETS BURNED IN MONTHS; corner stamp THE GAP CLOSES; the hyperagent\\'s brow furrows.

Panel 3 PROFIT COLLAPSE: same workshop; the HUD chart now glows angry red with the PER-TOKEN COST curve surpassing PER-SEAT REVENUE and arcing into a grey-shaded right-side zone labeled PROFIT COLLAPSE; the hyperagent\\'s armored gauntlet reaches toward a glowing control panel; chart stamp EVERY ADDITIONAL UNIT LOSES MONEY.

## What the chart shows

Picture two curves on the same axes.

The blue line is **per-seat revenue**. It is mostly flat or steps up in discrete jumps (subscription tiers, billable rate increases, occasional contract upsells). The customer pays a roughly fixed amount for a roughly fixed deliverable.

The red curve is **per-token AI compute cost**. It starts low while the employee is experimenting (cheap inference, small prompts). It climbs as the employee leans in: more context loaded, more tool calls, more model upgrades, more agentic loops, more parallel work. It does not climb linearly. It climbs the way compounding climbs.

There is a region where the two curves leave a healthy gap. The seat is profitable. The employee is using AI to do more than they could otherwise, and the cost of that AI is small relative to what the seat earns.

Then the red curve passes the blue line. The gap closes. The seat is still functioning, but the marginal hour of AI work is no longer paying for itself.

Then the red curve keeps going. The seat enters the **profit collapse** zone. The employee is shipping more than ever, but every additional unit of output is losing money.

![Framework chart. Two curves on the same axes. The blue PER-SEAT REVENUE line runs roughly flat across the time axis with subtle step changes at SUBSCRIPTION markers. The red PER-TOKEN AI COMPUTE COST curve starts low at INFERENCE on the left, climbs through TOKEN USAGE in the middle, and arcs upward into a labeled PROFIT COLLAPSE zone on the right where it has crossed and overtaken the revenue line. A green shaded area between the two curves on the left marks the healthy-margin region. A grey shaded area on the right marks the collapse zone.

## Why this is happening now

The subsidy era is ending in real time. Microsoft cancelled its internal Claude Code licenses in May 2026 after token-based billing made the cost untenable, even for the company with the deepest cloud and the largest stake in OpenAI. Uber's CTO sent an internal memo warning that the company burned through its entire 2026 AI budget in four months. American AI software prices have moved up 20 to 37 percent. GitHub is shifting flat-rate plans to usage-based billing.

> "Token-based pricing is forcing every enterprise customer to confront the actual cost of running these models at scale, and the number turns out to be far higher than the flat-rate experiments suggested."

Two paths land in the same place. Either enterprises scale back AI usage to fit budgets, which slows the revenue ramp the labs need to justify valuations ahead of IPOs, or the labs cut prices and absorb losses, which makes unit economics worse at exactly the wrong moment. Either way, the era when AI cost could be assumed to fall and AI value could be assumed to compound at the same time is over.

For the operator, this is not a financing story. It is a per-seat margin story. Every AI-using employee just became a small profit-and-loss that must be managed.

## The decision the operator faces per seat

The diagnostic is per-employee, not per-org. Three questions for any seat where AI is doing meaningful work.

1. **What revenue does this seat enable that would not exist without AI?** Not the seat's total contribution. The marginal contribution that AI specifically unlocked.
2. **What is the seat's monthly token bill?** Read it off the dashboard. If you do not have the dashboard, get the dashboard. An agentic business that cannot quote per-seat token spend from memory is operating blind.
3. **Is the gap getting bigger or smaller as the seat scales?** A seat that is moving from healthy margin toward the collapse zone needs intervention before it crosses, not after.

A seat with widening positive gap: invest. Give that employee more AI, better tools, more autonomy.

A seat in the collapse zone: cap or kill the AI spend on that seat. Move the employee to lower-token workflows or smaller models. Cross-train them off the high-leverage tasks AI is doing unprofitably.

A seat with negative gap and no obvious revenue lever: that role's compensation-plus-AI economics no longer work. Restructure the role, not the AI.

## The five operator levers against the squeeze

The squeeze is structural, not personal. The same five levers that work on [Lifetime Gross Profit](/concepts/lifetime-gross-profit) work here, retargeted at the AI-using seat instead of the customer.

1. **Raise the price the seat enables.** Premiumize the deliverable so the same hour of AI-assisted work earns more.
2. **Compress token use per task.** Smaller models for routine work, aggressive prompt discipline, prompt caching, hybrid local-and-API setups. Most AI workflows can cut spend 50 percent or more without losing quality if anyone is actually watching.
3. **Negotiate or move to per-seat-priced tools where available.** Flat-rate is back as a competitive wedge precisely because token-based billing is making customers nervous.
4. **Concentrate token spend on the highest-leverage employees.** A few power users with deep AI budgets often beat broad rollouts at thin per-seat budgets.
5. **Track per-seat token cost and revenue contribution monthly.** Operators who can recite the numbers tend to manage the gap. Operators who cannot tend to wake up to a budget already evaporated, the Uber outcome.

## What this is not

This is not "AI is too expensive." Plenty of seats are far inside the healthy-margin zone. This is also not "scale AI usage down across the board." Some seats should scale up, hard.

This is the discipline of treating each AI-using employee as a small enterprise with its own revenue, its own cost of goods, and its own margin. The agentic business is a portfolio of those small enterprises.

The operator who runs that portfolio with discipline survives the squeeze. The operator who treats AI as a line-item subscription does not.
